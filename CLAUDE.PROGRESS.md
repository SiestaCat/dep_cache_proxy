### Progress Log

#### 2025-01-06
- Implemented core domain models: hash_constants.py, blob_storage.py, dependency_set.py
- Created unit tests for dependency set and hash calculation
- All tests passing successfully
- Implemented cache_repository.py interface defining the contract for cache operations
- Implemented infrastructure/file_system_cache_repository.py with full functionality:
  - Stores individual file blobs with content-addressable storage
  - Creates JSON indexes mapping file paths to hashes
  - Generates ZIP files on demand from stored blobs
  - Supports thread-safe concurrent operations
  - Implements deduplication at the file level
- Created comprehensive tests for file system cache repository (15 tests, all passing)
- Fixed domain model imports and structure
- Added hash calculation utilities to infrastructure layer
- **FIXED**: Corrected project structure - moved files from incorrectly created server/ directory to proper root-level directories
- Updated import paths to use correct structure (e.g., `from domain.X import ...` instead of `from server.domain.X import ...`)
- Implemented API key validator with timing-safe comparison using hmac.compare_digest
- Created comprehensive unit tests for API key validator (6 tests, all passing)
- **NEW**: Re-implemented domain/dependency_set.py with improved design:
  - DependencyFile now stores content_hash instead of raw content
  - DependencySet uses generic versions dict instead of specific version fields
  - Added to_index_dict() method for JSON serialization
  - Improved hash calculation with sorted operations for determinism
- **NEW**: Created comprehensive unit tests for dependency_set.py:
  - Tests for deterministic hash calculation
  - Tests for manager differentiation
  - Tests for file order independence
  - Tests for index dictionary conversion
  - Tests for file hash calculation with various sizes
- **NEW**: Added calculate_file_hash() utility function for content hashing
- **FIXED**: Resolved DependencyFile API mismatch:
  - Reverted to original design where DependencyFile stores content (bytes) instead of content_hash
  - This matches the existing infrastructure expectations and test suite
  - Updated domain/dependency_set.py to use the correct API with content field
  - All 30 tests now passing successfully
- Implemented infrastructure/docker_utils.py with comprehensive Docker support:
  - Checks Docker availability with caching
  - Handles installation with Docker for version mismatches
  - Supports npm, yarn, composer, pipenv, and poetry package managers
  - Maps managers to appropriate Docker images
  - Generates secure install commands with --ignore-scripts flags
  - Collects installed files from appropriate directories
  - Includes proper error handling and timeouts
- Created comprehensive unit tests for docker_utils.py (18 tests, all passing):
  - Tests for Docker availability checks (success, failure, timeout, not installed)
  - Tests for lockfile/manifest name resolution
  - Tests for Docker image selection
  - Tests for install command generation
  - Tests for successful and failed Docker installations
  - Tests for file collection from installation directories
  - All tests use proper mocking to avoid actual Docker operations
- Implemented domain/installer.py with dependency installer pattern:
  - Created abstract DependencyInstaller base class defining the interface
  - Implemented NpmInstaller for npm package installation using npm ci
  - Implemented ComposerInstaller for PHP composer package installation
  - Created InstallerFactory for creating appropriate installers based on manager type
  - Each installer knows its output folder, lockfile name, and manifest name
  - Installers use --no-scripts flags for security
- Created comprehensive unit tests for installer components (12 tests, all passing):
  - Tests for NpmInstaller properties and installation (success/failure)
  - Tests for ComposerInstaller properties and installation (success/failure)
  - Tests for InstallerFactory creating correct installers
  - Tests for missing version parameters and unsupported managers
- Implemented application/dtos.py with data transfer objects:
  - FileData: Represents a file with relative path and content
  - CacheRequest: Input DTO with manager, versions, lock/manifest content
  - CacheResponse: Output DTO with bundle hash, download URL, cache hit status
  - InstallationResult: Internal DTO for installation process results
- Implemented application/handle_cache_request.py orchestration logic:
  - HandleCacheRequest class orchestrates the entire cache request flow
  - Determines whether to use Docker based on version support
  - Calculates bundle hash from request data
  - Checks cache for existing bundles (cache hit)
  - Handles cache miss by installing dependencies (native or Docker)
  - Stores installed files as blobs with content-addressable storage
  - Creates JSON index mapping paths to hashes
  - Generates ZIP file from stored blobs
  - Returns appropriate response with download URL
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and cleanup
